# 📖 "Capston project" <a name="about-project"></a>

**Capston project - Conference page** 

Is a project made with HTML, CSS and JS which purpose is to demonstrate my abilities mastering those development tools in a real case. 

This time the case is a conference page about comics and Superheros, the page count with two main sections that are Home and About page. 

In the Home there are 5 different sections
<ul>
  <li>Heading</li>
  <li>Main program</li>
  <li>Featured speakers</li>
  <li>Partner</li>
  <li>Footer</li>
</ul>

In the about page there are 3 sections

<ul>
  <li>Heading</li>
  <li>Meaning of the logo</li>
  <li>The past of the conferences</li>
</ul>

I need to clarifying that this is not a real conference page and I’m not the author of the design, to know more about the real author please move to the [Authors](#authors) section.
